 # Codes for Signatures of electronic ordering in transport in graphene flat bands
 
 The codes for generating the self consistent solutions can be found in the directory`Codes for generating self-consistent solution`.
 They are written in the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language.
 
 The codes for obtaining the plots are in the directory `Codes for plotting`. You will need [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) and [IJulia](https://juliapackages.com/p/ijulia) (a Julia kernel for Jupyter notebooks) to run them.
 
 The data files for average curvature obtained by running these codes are stored in OpenDocument Spreadsheet (.ods) format in the directory `data`.
